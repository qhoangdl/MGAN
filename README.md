Mixture Generative Adversarial Nets (MGAN)
======================================================

This TensorFlow code implements an example of MGAN for the CIFAR-10 dataset, presented in the paper "***MGAN: Training Generative Adversarial Nets with Multiple Generators***" accepted at the 6th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2018).

The code is tested on Linux-based operating system with Python 3.6, TensorFlow 1.2.1.

Run the model using this command:
-------------------------------------
	python main.py

Please kindly look at the file `main.py` for hyperparameter arguments.
